 ## Description
For week 14 we were tasked to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The applications folder structure was to follow the MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER paradigm. We would also be tasked with using the following packages, express-handlebars, mysql2, sequalize, dotenv-package, bcrypt.package, express-sessions, and connect-sessions-sequalize. Although I didn't get everything to work I managed to get it a majority of the application to work. Once I catch up on other assignments I will return to this and hopefully fix the errors I get.

 ## Installation
 Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself. After installing please open the root directory of the repo, click open terminal, and run the command.
```
npm i
```
After you should run the command. 
```
npm run seed
```
And finally to start the server simply run the command 
```
node server
```

 ## Usage
The main usage for the project was to build this application from scratch using all we learned from the weeks lesson. This is imporatant as this will allow more interactability with our applications for future project which will add more versatility to what we can do, allowing multiple users to access our application and have a tailor-made experience for there eyes only.

 ## Contributions
 For this project I used the student mini project for week 14 as the foundation of my code. I used the boiler code provided in the project and used the mini projects folder structure to implement into my own.<br />
 I would also like to give credit to Matthew Kang a classmate of mine for helping me out as well with the routes when I was lost.
