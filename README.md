 ## Description
For week 14 we were tasked to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The applications folder structure was to follow the MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER paradigm. We would also be tasked with using the following packages, express-handlebars, mysql2, sequalize, dotenv-package, bcrypt.package, express-sessions, and connect-sessions-sequalize.

 ## Installation
 Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself. After installing please open the root directory of the repo, click open terminal, and run the command.
```
npm i
```
After you should run the command. 
```
npm run seed
```
And finally to start the server simply run the command 
```
node server
```

 ## Usage
The main usage for the project was to build this application from scratch using all we learned from the weeks lesson. This is imporatant as this will allow more interactability with our applications for future project which will add more versatility to what we can do, allowing multiple users to access our application and have a tailor-made experience for there eyes only.

## Demonstration


 ## Contributions
 For this project I used the student mini project for week 19 as the foundation of my code. I also used some of the functions provided by it as well.<br />
 I would also like to thank the module for the challenge as well, as I used the gif imaged to assit me when trying to reproduce the results.
